# Generated Theme Files

This folder contains simplified JSON theme files that have been processed from the original complex theme files.

The simplified format:
- Removes the `type` and nests values directly
- Resolves token references (e.g., `{radius.rounded-sm}` becomes the actual value)
- Flattens the structure for easier consumption
